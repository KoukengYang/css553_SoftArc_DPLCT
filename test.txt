If you can SEE this message ONLY ONCE, then that means that our
architecture works via C2 message passing from top to bottom, and our
components KNOW how to IGNORE multiples of the same requests due to 
C2 connector duplication via broadcasting to multiple branches. You should see
4 full requests going into the storage unit, but you should only see this 
message once becuase the storage unit only did the request once ignoring the
others.

As a test 1, the UI requested this test file be open by storage and have storage
send the data sent back to the UI for displaying. The UI request traveled up 
the C2 architecture to the storage component, the storage component fulfilled 
the message request, and sent a notification back down to the UI containing 
this message. The UI is to then display this message to standard out as a test. 

The data must have been open properly as you are reading this on your screen lol...
Yep, it's another one of those looooooooooooooooooooong nights for me lol. 
It's past 6AM so Im gonna go shleep naoh....
