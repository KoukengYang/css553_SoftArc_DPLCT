# css553_SoftArc_DPLCT
This repository holds code for the Data provenance log compiler tool.

I just threw my whole netbeans project onto GitHub (built on NetBeans 8.1). 

If you download this as a zip you should be able to open it in netbeans as a project. 

-Package DPLCT is the package we will be working in.

-Package c2 is the imported package we got from the lectures in which we will be using.

-Go through the built-in tutorial on using Github if you are not familier with GitHub. It'll make it much easier to understand.
