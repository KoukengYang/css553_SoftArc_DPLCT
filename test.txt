If you can SEE this ONLY ONCE, then that means that our
architecture works via C2 message passing from top to bottom, and our
components KNOW how to INORE multiples of the same requests due to 
C2 connector duplication via broadcasting to multiple branches.

As a test 1, the UI requested this file be open and the data sent back to it.
The UI request traveled up the C2 architecture to the storage component,
the storage component fulfilled the message request, and sent a notification 
back down to the UI containing this message. The UI is to then display 
this message as a test. 

The data must have been open properly as 
you are reading this on your screen lol...
Yep, it's another one of those looooooooooooooong nights for me lol. 
It's past 5AM so Im gonna go shleep naoh....
